# DATASCI_266_Final_Project

***Important: The T5_Model_Experiments file is not rendering correctly, we have emailed it to the instructors***

This is the repo for Sarah Hoover, Ifrah Javed and Florencia Froebel's final DATASCI266 project. All datasets generated are included in the data folder. This folder also has scripts used for feature engineering. The "scripts" folder has scripts with outputs for our baseline models (BERT Experiments has the Baseline Model metrics) and all experiments run. The final paper is titled "Final Report". 

This project is titled “Fake News” Detection: An Exploration of Using Natural Language Processing Methodologies to Identify the Degree and Presence of Misinformation.With an increase of information-sharing platforms and widespread accessibility to them, anyone has the capability to share information and have it reach millions of people. Although beneficial, this also lends to widespread misinformation, coined as “Fake News”.  This paper builds on current research to develop a tool that can utilize linguistic features to identify the degree of false information in a piece of text, specifically focusing on political claims in the LIAR dataset. Our results demonstrate that the pre-trained T5 model yields improvement over BERT-based architectures. It also shows that incorporation of information about the negative emotion in the text and contextual text data are valuable features when applied to a six-way classification task.
